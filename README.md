# FastDVDnet_Pytorch
This method is primarily designed for denoising videos but can also be applied to denoising three or more images with the same size. Begin by creating noisy images from high resolution using the 'NoisyImages.ipynb' notebook. Note that the noisy images can be found in the 'Noisy.zip' folder, with 0.jpg and 1.jpg generated by Gaussian noise and the other two by Salt and Pepper noise.
To test this method on noisy images, use the 'FastDVDnet.ipynb' file. Pay attention to the following warnings to ensure accurate results. After cloning the GitHub repository to your Google Drive, navigate to 'utils.py' and replace "skimage.measure.simple_metrics import compare_psnr" with "from skimage.metrics import peak_signal_noise_ratio as compare_psnr." Now, you can execute other parts of 'FastDVDnet.ipynb' to obtain the results.
For varied results, you can modify the value of noise_sigma in the command: !python test_fastdvdnet.py --test_path "/content/drive/MyDrive/Noisy" --noise_sigma 30 --save_path "/content/drive/MyDrive/FastDVDnet_Results". The results of this method on noisy images with different values of noise sigma are stored in 'FastDVDnet_results.zip'.
